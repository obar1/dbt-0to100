With this option you’ll be able to check the status of your freelancer anytime. The only thing left to do is to evaluate the work before submission and analyze freelancer’s output vs. time ratio. Pay for quality results We operate with a unique payment system, which has been created to establish strong working relationships, based on trust and confidence. The payment system we apply makes the transaction process safe and fair. Clients complete the payment release, calculated and based on the freelancer’s performed working hours weekly. The mentioned amount stays on the Escrow account till the client’s approval of the completed task, milestone or project.

Personal and interpersonal skills We have some case questions for our candidates in order to understand what their behavior can be like in critical, stressful or unpredicted situations. This way, we can be sure that they are the best match for us, as we typically only accept candidates with exceptional results.",Free,null,"[""Software as a Service (SaaS)""]",https://www.facebook.com/ItHire-349601302779441,null,,[],[],"[""hire-talent"", ""hire-remote-workers"", ""freelancer-marketplace"", ""hire-developers""]","[""Truelancer"", ""Toptal"", ""Workopolis""]",49
